# Unit 3 Homework: Python

Here I will look to analyze finanical records of a bank and help a small, rural town modernize its vote counting process.

## Bank Financial Records Analysis

Here I was given a set of financial records from my company and will create a python script to take a look at:

* The total number of months included in the dataset

* The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

* The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes

* The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

* The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

My analysis looks like the following:

  ```text
  Financial Analysis
  ----------------------------
  Total Months: 86
  Total: $22564198
  Average Change: $-8311.11
  Greatest Increase in Profits: Aug-16 ($1862002)
  Greatest Decrease in Profits: Feb-14 ($-1825558)
  ```

## PyPoll Instructions

For my second task I will help a small rural town modernize its vote counting process.

I was given a dataset of election data with Voter ID, County and Candidate. I then created a script to analyze the following:

* The total number of votes cast

* A complete list of candidates who received votes

* The percentage of votes each candidate won

* The total number of votes each candidate won

* The winner of the election based on popular vote.

My analysis results were:
